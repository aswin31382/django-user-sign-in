# django-user-sign-in
finally,the user login,registration and task list have been created with django..the special thing about this is after 5 minutes of inactivity u will be prompted to login again as the session will be expired
So,if you are the admin of this page and you want to see or delete any existing user,u can do that by accessing the page with /admin option
In that you can see all the registered users and u can create,change or delete the users database
Before running the server make sure you installed all the required pip packages
For this timeout function you need to install session time out package by entering the following code in terminal
